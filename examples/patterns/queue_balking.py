# Balking is a situation in which an arriving customer does not join the queue but
# goes away or goes someplace else. Example: The owner of the petrol station has the
# feeling that some potential clients are leaving the station because there is no place 
# to wait for service. Assumption: one car arrives on average each 4 minutes
# (according to a Poisson process) and the service time is uniformly distributed between 1 and 6 minutes.
# The maximum queue capacity is 4.
